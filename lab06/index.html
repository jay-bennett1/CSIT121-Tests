  You can prepare by pulling your steak out of the fridge to get closer to room temperature (we want to avoid it being too cold in the center). Put a very thin layer of olive oil on either side and coat generously with salt and pepper. Ideally, you should let this sit for about 15-20 minutes. While you wait, begin cutting your thyme out of the bundle and chopping your garlic cloves into slices. Once you're ready, we can begin.
  <ol>
  <li>Set the stove to high to heat the pan.</li>
  <li>Once the pan is blistering hot, put a small piece of butter on to coat it and gently lay the steak flat.</li>
  <li>Let the steak sear for 2-3 minutes until a dark-brown crust forms on the edges. It should not be cooking all the way through.</li>
  <li>Put another piece of butter into the pan, this time accompanied by your garlic cloves and thyme.</li>
  <li>Flip the steak onto the uncooked side and while cooking, baste the butter, garlic, and thyme onto the top of the steak repeatedly for another 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Flip the steak one more time and baste for 30-40 seconds, then pull the steak off the pan.</li>
  <li>Let the steak rest for 4-5 minutes to capture the juice within the meat, then serve immediately after.</li>
</ol>

This recipe is one of my favorites because I've gotten good at being able to prepare multiple cuts and grades of steak. No matter how cheap or expensive the cut, it will always turn out great and is even better when it's companied by a side. My favorite foods to couple a steak with are fries, baked potato, or broccoli. Below is a website with many free recipes, although I can't guarantee that they'll be as good as this one:
